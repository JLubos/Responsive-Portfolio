    			Hi, My name Is Justin Lubos. I have been coding for quite a while with knowledge in C++, Javascript, Unity, etc. I was born in Edison, New Jersey and moved to Texas back somewhere in the 2000's. I have an obsession with basketball, video games, anime, comics, anything nerdy but most importantly music. In my spare time I like to watch a lot of documentaries and mess with my fidget spinner. When it comes to basketball some of my faovrite players are Steve Nash, Charles Barkley, Yao Ming, Chris Webber, Jason Kidd, Kobe, Kyrie Irving, James Harden, Patrick Beverly. My long term goal is to hopefully be game developer one day!
